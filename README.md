The Odin Project - HTML/CSS exercise

This is my first attempt at recreating a web page. This is also the first exercise after completing the css/html lessons in the WebDev 101 section. 

List of skills I have used: 
- flexbox
- hover 
- css
- html

	The page is very close to matching at full screen size, however I did not make it resposive to changes to screen size. When resized, the content tends to get misaligned and smashed together. 
	Also did not make the app dropdowns, user dropdowns, and the hover image description. All this I hope to come back and finish in the future.
